//  Q45 -- Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly..

const car = (model, manufacturer,...more) => {
  var obj = {
    model,
    manufacturer,
    more
  };
  console.log(obj);
  return model, manufacturer;

};
 car("2010","civic","color: red","spped: 600kmh")
