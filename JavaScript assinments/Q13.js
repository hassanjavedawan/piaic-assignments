//  Q13 -- Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

let arr = ["My favorite motorcycle is Yamaha YBR 125","Engine size is 124cc","Fuel capacity is 12 litres","Rear tyre size is 90/90 x 18"]

arr.forEach(element => {
    console.log(element);
});
